Things to do before launch
===

This project is not a "django template" project because I did not want to force people to pick a name, therefore i choose the lamest of all, "PROJECT". When you have a name, please rename PROJECT to the project name, and change the SECRET_KEY to a new random string. Please remove db.sqlite3 and recreate it.
